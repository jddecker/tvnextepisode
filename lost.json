 "From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his "

 "who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's "
 'wounds. Hurley - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate '
 'situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to '
 'survive. Charlie is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid is '
 'a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at '
 'him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin and Sun are a Korean couple whose '
 'traditions, values and language are foreign, and thus causes much to get '

 'bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. And young Claire '
 'is eight months pregnant and ill-prepared for the hardships of motherhood - '
